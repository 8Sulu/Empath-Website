    Are you an empath?
    </p>
    <p>
    Ever go in a room and something feels off or weird?  Ever get angry at someone mad at you, but you actually were not angry at them?  Ever sit next someone and for some reason you feel really good or excited?  To the same note, ever get next to someone, and suddenly feel bad, etc?  Do people often open up to you or want to hang out with you just to be with you.  These are some signs you may be empathic.  You can feel others emotions as if they were your own.
    </p>
    <p>
    I encourage you to search on the internet for one of the many websites offering 10 or 20 questions to “are you an empath?”.  It is best to take tests from websites you relate too, I relate to the Loner Wolf one and Judith Orloff.
