      My mom grabbed my toddler age brother and sister in the middle of the night, while I was maybe three months inside her womb. She left my dad (that she labels as an alcoholic) in the middle of the night, fled from Canada, and drove to Miami Florida to live near her sister. That’s how my physical life started this time, chaos, anxiety, fear, abandonment, insecurity, unfamiliar environment.

      That was 1969.  Many great things happened in the next +/- 43 years.  Married at 29.  Three wonderful children.  A glassblowing career and ongoing structural engineering career.  Things started to shift when I asked myself, and my wife at the time, “we are better friends, a great team in many ways, have bettered our lives in many ways, why are we not verbally – emotionally – physically more intimate?”
      </p>

      Fast forward; the start of this new journey, in 2012 was a 30 hour weekend personal growth workshop entitled “TLC”.  The Living Course, which I understand was similarly offered in many states.  During this weekend you “do / roleplay” anger fear mad sad glad shame to “200%”.  The idea is you start to break the eggshell of childhood protections.  This presents an opportunity to reconnect with your true self.  I went back as an assistant every six weeks for a couple years.  For the first time in my life I started to express anger, and in a healthy way.  I reconnected with many hobbies and got some new ones.  I still regularly read, beach volleyball, fish/or beach/ or parks-nature, meditate.  I learned many things as a result of this and like to think I “graduated” from these teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
      Next I joined a therapist led 8 person men’s group soon in 2013.  I attended this for 1 year.  Two main goals I had and achieved in this was “to be direct” with communication and personal interaction.  And to increase intimacy.  During this time I learned to love other men, young women, love everyone!!  (With regard of my childhood it was unsafe to love anyone but me mom…).  I am a very loving person so this was very freeing for me. The therapist acknowledged I learned many things and he understood my desire to venture on to different learning modes.  I left on good terms and reached out to him for help from time to time after this.
      </p>
      <p>
      During the same year I also did individual sessions with the same therapist about once every 2 weeks.  This individual therapy helped me process items from the weekend workshop, and men’s group.
      </p>

      Around this time I was introduced to AA (Alcohlics anonymous).  A great program for those new to trying to abstain.  I still have AA in my thoughts and a tool if needed.  I have learned, improved, and shifted and fill my time with other healthy things.
      </p>
      <p>
      Starting in 2014 for the next 2.5 years I had a weekly 1 hour call with a business / life coach.  I made changes in my engineering office and soon it became a place I loved again.  I significantly reduced daily anxiety.  With his help I mostly stopped the “what if’s” as he would call it.  My work life and individual life greatly improved and was pretty good.  I started to try to make improvements on my marriage but I have since learned any change in a relationship must happen as an agreement, that is followed through by both parties.  My weekly calls were very inspiring and by the time I stopped the coaching my level of life fulfillment went from ok, to good.
      </p>

      In 2017, I learned I am an “Empath”.  Within a few months of weekly coaching, my unhealthy almost daily drinking of alcohol was cut in half!  50%!!  Naturally, with pleasure.  I learned I could sense and feel others emotions as if they were my own, in my own body.  I also learned tools to protect myself, distinguish others emotions from my own.  I also went through my first “spiritual awakening”.  For about 6 months, every 2 or 3 weeks, a flood of a particular accumulated emotion left my body.  When these events happened If I was in my car I had to pullover they were so intense.  I did this from a psychic / empath perspective, but there is published material from psychologists with regards of releasing trapped motions.  I did this empath coaching for over a year.  The other modes of healing were life changing, this is the first one I realized in the moment, my life is incredibly changing for the better.  In 2024 I entered into a new program with this person to work on advanced empath and other psychic learings.

      In 2018 at a spiritual seminar in Sedona Arizona, I met an energy healer.  For about the next year I released “things” stuck in my body that were not mine, or no longer needed.  I often did my sessions at 5pm on Fridays.  Those were the best “happy hours” of my life.  And I called them that!  We worked on agendas I brough to the table, or things in the moment, and often paralleled them all with past experiences.  Each month I felt emotionally lighter and lighter.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2019 I started working on a 36 lesson psychic and communication curriculum - lesson plan.  My communication significantly improved.  This person also had experience as a family therapist and helped my with ongoing drinking and relationship difficulties.  In 2025 I reconnected with this person to expand my psychic communication and other nontraditional learnings.

      In late 2021 I lived for 30 days in a recovery facility.  It was basically 6 different types of therapy each day for 1 hour each, 7 days a week.  A CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) perspective.  It had great amenities and I also saw an individual therapist twice a week.  This restarted many things in my life.  My business coach wanted me to do something like this but it took my wife at the time to say, “if you want to come back home, you need to do that”.  My overall life was the best it ever was, but I did this to save my marriage.  I think almost all middle aged people would greatly benefit from this.  This helped me focus on myself for 30 days straight, all day.  I left this place inspired, brought many of the qualities I had my whole life back to the surface, and felt better than ever.

      It is reasonable to state during all the time since 2012 there has been periods of abstaining from drinking alcohol.  As the years have gone by, it is more appropriate to state periods of sobriety.  Drinking alcohol has become unimportant.  I love feeling my feelings, and now most often they are “good feelings”.  I can enter altered states quickly through meditation if desired.  For the past few years I have mostly lived in sobriety.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2020 I started another year with the same energy healer.  During this time, I continued with getting help removing things “stuck in my body”.  I also learned to do this myself.  On pretty much a daily basis I meditate / scan my body for accumulated emotional or energetic items.  Often each week, for many minutes, I sit shedding tears of bliss, because I feel so good.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many things I have learned from all the above people, have greatly improved my life.  And, my effort, with regards of my own life, is the greatest attribute to my current state of being.  At about 2017 I started sometimes saying “this is the best 5 years of my life”.  There was on period of over a year of great difficulty.  Now, measured as a whole, I can confidently say, this is the best 13 years of my life!  And I hope to be entering the best year of my life.
