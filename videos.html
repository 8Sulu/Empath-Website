    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>
      My mom grabbed my brother and sister in the middle of the night while I was maybe three months inside her womb.
      She
      left my dad that she labels as an alcoholic in the middle of the night from Canada, and drove to Miami Florida to
      live near her sister. That’s how my physical life started this time, chaos, anxiety, fear, abandonment,
      insecurity,
      unfamiliar environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      My childhood had a huge underlying sense of connection and deep love. The only way to have connection with my dad
      is
      through “acts of service”. I grew up helping my dad renovate his house my whole life and that’s how I got valuable
      connection with him from age 5 to probably 25. I instantly I bet by the age of three years old became a people
      pleaser doing whatever my mom wanted so I would never suffer the difficulty my brother and sister that I witnessed
      happening. My brother and sister think I was the “golden child“. Maybe there’s truth than that but I lost myself
      growing up doing everything I could not to get abused to please my mom. I did learn a lot about crafts and even
      sports for my mom on the surface and below the surface what I learned was “no matter what I did it was never good
      enough“. so active service was a big thing in my childhood and at the same time I did get a lot of fulfillment
      from
      both parents through these access service with “quality time.“ Thank goodness we got a dog when I was I think
      around
      10 years old maybe younger because I got a ton of physical affection from that dog growing up. I don’t know if it
      was 11 or 15 years we had that dog. Thank goodness because physical affection and quality time are probably my two
      most important love languages. Petting and hugging that dog was the shit!(that means really awesome).
    </p>
    <p>
      I married when I was 29 years old and that’s the first time I moved out of my family home and into a new place of
      living. I instantly had a deep connection with my wife“ something so deep it’s like we experienced past lives
      together. When I see my ex-wife, we still have an awesome connection joking around and we know a lot about each
      other which is very calming. One amazing thing that happened was my mom passed on the alcoholic baton to my wife
      at
      the time. Till the day my mom passed away in 2019 my brother would not put any alcohol or in fridge or drink
      around
      her. my mom talked about my dad‘s drinking till the day my mom died. In the last year, my mom‘s life I told her
      mom
      “dad has been dead for 20 years, he drank three times in my entire life, I understand it was for one to two months
      each time, but it was still three times in 35 years, he’s been dead for 20 years and you still talk about it!
      What’s
      amazing is my mom would help me professionally blow glass on the other coast of Florida every weekend for years.
      We
      would drive there and often spend the night and drive back. on Fridays sometimes I would go there and drive back
      the
      same night and I don’t know if it was half the time, but it was a lot that I would drink a few beers during glass
      blowing and on the way home, I understand it’s illegal, on the one and a half hour drive I would drink a large
      beer
      on the way home and chitchat with my mom with a incredible loving connection and she was totally at peace with it.
      so that’s passing the baton to my wife at the time. At some point before this time or throughout 10 years or so I
      did realize that if I didn’t like doing something sober that I would never do a drinking. That was a big step for
      me
      that I did not realize how important it was because I was on the path to eliminating things in my life that I
      didn’t
      enjoy, and the only reason I liked them was because I was numbing out, which meant I didn’t like them! . This is
      the
      beginning of my process “out with the bad, and with a good” About 11 years ago I was sharing with my wife and I
      kind
      of shared it with one of her new best friends at the time that we’ve been married for 10 years dating for 20 years
      and we’re a better friendly team, a better team at home, better connected in so many ways, but we are not more
      mentally and physically intimate or comfortable with each other. That didn’t make sense to me and that did bring a
      little bit of puzzlement to my wife at the time too. Well, my wife’s best friend at the time shared with me this
      personal growth weekend workshop that you thought would be wonderful and that’s what started an 11 year journey of
      personal growth for me. In the next 11 years, I experienced how I categorize six different modes of learning and
      Healing. In the weekend, person growth workshop basically you crack, the eggshell of childhood protections and
      experience all of the difficulty emotions like fear and anger at 200% with exercises and leave the weekend feeling
      inspired like you wanna take on the World. I did go back to that weekend workshop probably more than 20 times in
      the
      audience however in the next year, my biggest learning was in an eight person therapist lead men’s group and I
      also
      went to individual therapy probably every two weeks with the same therapist. I like to think I “graduated from
      that“” and the next part of my journey for about the next 2 1/2 years with a life coach and business coach I met
      that sometimes spoke in front of thousands of people. I found him very talented. He brought love back to my
      structural engineering office that I love, and with his help I stopped the “what ifs”, and Brought fulfillment
      with
      friends and workplace. The third big step was brought to my attention during a month period of sobriety by a
      friend
      of mine who told me “the reason you knew this person was feeling differently than they were sharing on the outside
      is that you’re a “empath””. I went on the Internet and looked up what that was and found a new guide, life coach
      to
      learn about being an empath. That may have been the biggest shift of my life. It immediately stopped 50% of my
      drinking. How incredible to learn that many of the things.(I don’t know about 50% in groups, but it’s) I feel are
      not mine in a situation. And many of the things I continue to feel throughout the day are not mine! There are
      things
      I have absorbed and are just clinging to me. I learned about energy bubbles, sensing other people‘s emotions
      differentiating them from mine. Once I realize that most people accumulate in emotions and similar things in their
      body as they age and learn some ways to get rid of them, I went through my first awakening. And awakening bring
      lots
      of joy and fulfillment and it’s also can be emotional terror at times. I would describe in a nutshell that there
      was
      waves of emotion released from me in groups and sometimes the way would last a day and almost always there would
      be
      about 20 minutes to an hour where time accumulated emotion left my body. When fear left my body, I started feeling
      overwhelmed in a group situation, actually that weekend workshop that I went back to one time, I quickly left the
      room and went to my car, turned up my radio full blast on a particular song that I found in that moment turned my
      12
      inch subwoofer in stereo full blast and screamed bloody terror for 10 minutes with tears streaming down my face. I
      was Horse after that and incredibly, incredibly relieved like I was floating in the clouds, thank God to get rid
      of
      that! This type of event probably happens seven times over a year with each family of emotion. I imagine it is
      good
      that left it left my body but when passion type emotion left my body it was like a whole body overwhelming orgasm
      that may have been better than I felt even on the drug ecstasy, that wave of emotion “hit me twice“ and one time I
      was in the drive-through at Kentucky Fried chicken and when I pulled up to the window, the girl that worked there
      for a couple years that was 10 years younger than me was dancing and gyrating at the window, that’s how strong the
      emotional burst was exiting me. I probably could’ve asked that girl to take a break in the back room with me, but
      I
      was married and I’m not that type of guy. I did however, run to a safe place that I could have a “party with
      myself
      real quick“ and that was a really good party if you know what I mean! during my period with my end path coach, I
      went to a spiritual retreat in Sedona, Arizona and I met a new life coach, an Energy Healer that’s specialized in
      removing trapped emotions and other stuff that was all spiritual or psychic. My most common meeting time with her
      was Friday at 5 PM and that is probably my favorite “happy hours“ that I’ve had in my life. I worked with her for
      like every week for six months or close to a year and during that time, I felt emotionally lighter and lighter and
      I
      even got rid of two allergies that turned out to be “emotional allergies“ I have been allergic to Keylime peel my
      whole life starting from when I was like 21 years old and that was because of a trigger that happened in the
      Bahamas. I’ve been squeezing all types of limes and Key, limes for five years or more another amazing thing I was
      wearing no strips for probably close to 30 years so that I could sleep half decent at night. That was also a
      strong
      emotional allergy and I’ve been sleeping for more than five years with no no strips it is freaking amazing. During
      these times, these years, I was drinking less and less alcohol because I was improving my life. The first time I
      did
      try to achieve long-term sobriety I do attribute a great amount of help to the AA program. It is a great wonderful
      network. I do think it’s a great place for somebody that’s first attempting sobriety or one of the other similar
      programs. I am of the belief that it is not a life goal but more temporary support mechanism and then it’s
      valuable
      to go onto other Healing type venues so I do not attribute AA as one of my six healing modes, but it is absolutely
      worth mentioning on my website. My Energy Healer coach was going out of town for a long period of time and that
      open
      up an avenue for my next coach, which is has many talents, but with her I mostly focused on a 36 lesson psychic
      learning. That program is very well rounded, and you learn about many psychic talents and discover which ones you
      may have and there’s also many lessons about communication. it’s a very well rounded program and she has extensive
      training and traditional learning in the United States and is also a psychic expert. I am most enjoyed the
      learning
      about so many nontraditional things that are available to human beings. I say human beings because I am very
      comfortable in the belief that there’s many other life forms out there, why not the universe is such a big place.
      I
      am OK with what other people think and I am a believer that we are a spiritual beings having a physical experience
      as a human being.

      at some point I went to a “30 day live in Healing place“. This place was six hours a day of therapy. No phones no
      contact with the outside world. There was cognitive behavioral theory, art therapy, physical therapy, a personal
      therapist, an oasis in the middle of the facility with the pool and Jacuzzi and trees and palm trees, a jogging
      track, outback, You get to pick your own lunch and dinner, which was gourmet in my opinion, your own private room
      it
      was probably the best vacation of my life and I wish I could’ve gone there forever. It reminded me of going to
      college. Most places like this people just go to detox But this is an incredible place of learning and one of the
      best experiences of my life. It was like the weekend workshop, but for 30 days straight. I would always hear about
      movie stars and rich people going to places like that and now I get it. My life coach of 2 1/2 years often
      recommended I do something like that and I wasn’t interested. I’m glad I finally went. I really was able to focus
      on
      what was important to me and set aside. Everything else. I went back to the Energy Healer to continue work. I’m
      not
      sure if it was right then or sometime before that I went through a second awakening. It’s almost like waking up
      from
      a dream or thinking your whole life you were dreaming and now you’re awake or now I’m finally dreaming, you get
      the
      point! This next time I really started to successfully Grass how to manage my emotions on a daily basis and remove
      anything. I absorbed emotionally during the day on my own. The Energy Healer and probably most of the people I’ve
      dealt with over the last 11 years all encourage me to learn these things and to learn how to do them on my own.
      It’s
      amazing how much work it is on a daily basis, hourly basis, to keep myself feeling good, normal. I really love how
      this one pretty famous motivational or Healing type person says “what is interfering with my inner peace“. I say
      it’s a lot of work to stay feeling good because for me if I have anxiety drinking one beer, any kind of emotion
      it’ll be gone. It was not only five years ago that I was so filled with emotion, drinking less, and less as the
      years go by, feeling my feelings, more and more, what was happening was I was feeling 50 years of accumulated low
      vibration, emotion and honest to God. I told many people that I just wanna rip my chest out. It feels so awful.
      I’m
      very glad there was many people in my life that were accepting and understood that drinking a couple beers that
      would dissipate. It’s a lot better than other unhealthy alternatives. It’s definitely not a long-term goal but a
      short term immediate coping mechanism. As the years have gone by, it’s not really work anymore. It’s just part of
      my
      daily routine. I often wondered why this Energy Healer would work on herself like almost every day“ now I get it.
      Almost every day I’ll notice something interfering with my inner peace and I might be able to pause and within a
      minute shift back to my normal self. Still though, almost every day something happens, and I am feeling bad,
      sometimes it lasts for a whole day before I get the willpower to sit down, calm myself, and do a body scanner or
      one
      of the other many things I do, I often have tears running down my face partway through the process and that’s when
      I
      know I’m shifting, it’s shifted,. I enter into a state of bliss or incredible gratitude being expressed from my
      physical body that it is so incredibly happy that I have taken the time to acknowledge my body, and clear whatever
      difficulty was I was experiencing. So nowadays, instead of drinking a beer or four or more beers almost every
      night
      of the week like I did 11 years ago pretty much every day I meditate as society calls it, for probably 5 to 20
      minutes. It might be a few moments throughout the day for just a minute or two where I close my eyes and stand
      still
      or sit down. there’s some days where my brain feels mentally full, and I will sit in a lounge chair or lay with my
      head propped up for 25 to 45 minutes and do a deep meditation where I’m in a semi dream state which I love and
      after that my brain is very happy and my body. so now every day throughout the day and every week I mindfully do
      things
      to
      stay in a great state of mind. If there are some great difficulty, then I do something to counteract it or balance
      it out or appropriately. It’s been 11 years of “end with a good, out with the bad“
