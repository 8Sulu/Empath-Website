    <h2>Empower Your Empathy</h2>
    <p>
    Would you like to journey with me and rediscover what you’re passionate about?
    </p>
    <p>
    Would you like to venture with me, and rediscover who it is that you be?  You Are Born with Everything You Need! (to have a fulfilling wonderful life).  School (and possibly work) guide us to be successful members of society. That is not necessarily at the core of who you are, the gift that you are That YOU WERE born with and BORN TO BE.
    </p>
    <p>
    As life goes by, and you live and learn, instead of growing more peaceful, do you feel more emotionally entangled, overwhelmed, “emotionally full“. Would you like to discover, or rediscover ways to live more peacefully and serene, giving space for moment of excitement and passion!
    </p>
    <p>
    To achieve peacefulness and serenity is often the way to achieve this by drinking alcohol, or other mind body numbing processes? Alcohol or drugs will do that! Unfortunately ,they also get rid of joy and all the other high vibration emotions that everybody loves!
    </p>
    <p>
    I am all for “everything in moderation”. More purposefully, I am a firm believer that moving forward on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis towards feeling joy and passion and daily basis. When the emotions come up that we do not want to sit with, (as much as possible) acknowledge them, as difficult as it is & experience it, and live it in the moment (for a few minutes which may seem like forever)!  Feel your feelings, be honest with yourself, and many times those difficult emotions will pass quickly.  This is a healing moment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sometimes, for even 24 hours or longer I feel like shit (or similar). Sometimes it’s paired with resistance and I want to sit in my shit!!  Eventually, I start doing one of the many things I have learned over the years to shift into “my inner peace”.   Almost always within a few minutes of starting one of these self healing methods I shift to feeling “good”.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have experienced loss of parents, loss of almost 25 year marriage, loss of a longer relationship with alcohol as a coping mechanism.  The loss of my marriage.  I still love the woman I have have an over 35 year relationship with. We still lived together during the year of our separation and one of my three kids said, “even though my wife and I were getting permanently separated for the rest of our lives, It appeared that our household had more love, peacefulness, and connection than most friends that she directly or indirectly spoke to in high school”. I had a huge part in the reason of that and it is really wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have also experience the loss of living as anxious attachment, or living in anxiety.  Learing I was AN EMPATH, is one huge shift toward more stable emotions.  Dropping beer, soda, potatoes – rice – etc (I love dessert!) also “flattened out” my emotions.  I no longer miss the large waves of emotion from a sugar or caffeine or relationship struggle.  I am aware I am more steadily living in peace and self love to the point it brings tears to my eyes almost on a daily basis for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
    ‘Peace, love, rock ‘n’ roll!”  A common expression. I am more like a meditate, (self love self acceptance) for self and others, rave dance party!  Maybe one day I’ll think of this expression to have a better ring to it!
    </p>
    <p>
    If you relate to some of my bio items, or items above, I encourage you to take the step of contacting me.  Any difficult natural wave of life experience you’re going through that you would like a helpful hand, and my support.
