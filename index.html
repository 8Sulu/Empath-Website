    <h2>Empower Your Empathy</h2>
    <p>Would you like to journey with me and rediscover what you’re passionate about?</p>
    <p>Would you like to venture with me, and rediscover who it is that you be, you’re born with everything you need.
      School and work guide us to be successful members of society. That is not necessarily at the core of who you are,
      the gift that you are That you were born with and born to be.</p>
    <p> As life goes by, and you live and learn, instead of growing more peaceful, do you feel more emotionally,
      entangled, overwhelm, “emotionally full“, reminiscing in. Would you like to discover, or rediscover ways to live
      more peacefully and serene, giving space For moment of excitement and passion!</p>
    <p> It’s speaking of peacefulness and serenity. He’s often be on the way to achieve that by drinking alcohol, or
      other
      minded body coming processes? They will do that! Many times, almost instantly. Any other overwhelming low
      vibration emotion. You know what? Unfortunately they also get rid of joy and all the other high vibration emotions
      that everybody loves! Yes, anytime I have experienced joy and passion periods of drunkenness, etc. the thing is
      they’re very short-lived and the only time that occurs is when they are extreme emotions. No offense, I am all for
      everything in moderation, including recreational substances. On a similar note, I am a firm believer that moving
      forward on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis towards Feeling joy and passion and daily basis and when the
      emotions come up that we do not want to sit with, acknowledge him, as difficult as it is experience it, and live
      it in the moment! Feel your feelings, be honest with yourself, and many times those difficult emotions will pass
      quickly. Most often quickly as a few minutes, but I still sometimes for even 24 hours feel like shit. There’s many
      things I do that even when I feel like shit overall I’m content and fulfilled and am able to remember that soon,
      that fucking joy will be here. Why am I saying that, well because we’re discussing a moment when I feel like shit
      and in that moment, I’m angry or something like that and in that moment, I’m not feeling peaceful I’m fucking
      angry and my angry self wants that fucking joy that’s ahead of me.</p>
    <p> Any difficult natural wave of life experience you’re going through that you would like a helpful hand, a
      supportive person like me to have at your side. I’m very relevant sad and significant moment for me I am
      experiencing at the writing of this. I just found out one of my top clients for many years doesn’t personally like
      me at this moment. The only thing I can really do right now is pray, or the thing I often do is mindfully and
      maybe psychically send positive energy and hopes of healing energy towards this person with the intention to
      remove any ill feelings between me and them. Overall, I’m a very kind and loving person so it brings me great
      sadness when somebody doesn’t like me most likely because of some accident little situation definitely
      unintentional ill feelings that caused this person. There’s many difficult things in life people go through. I
      have experienced lots of parents, loss of almost 25 year marriage. I still love the woman. I have had an over 35
      year relationship with. She is effing awesome! There is also many reasons why, fulfilling and good reasons that I
      was important to move on from that marriage. We still lived together during the year of our separation and one of
      my three kids said, even though my wife and I were getting permanently separated for the rest of our lives. It
      appeared that our household had more love, peacefulness, and connection than most friends that she directly or
      indirectly spoke to in high school. I had a huge part in the reason of that and it is really wonderful. It is also
      a great loss and a lot of sadness not being able to hang out with my best of best friends for the last 35 years.
      So there we have it a huge joy and a huge sadness side-by-side. Society, TV will have us sit in the sad and
      anxiety and all the other stuff that comes with a great loss but often these moments are full of other things that
      it’s more fulfilling to devote our energy and time too.</p>
    <p> Peace, love, rock ‘n’ roll! A common expression. I am more like a meditate, self love for yourself and self
      acceptance for others, rave dance party! Maybe one day I’ll think of it expression that has a better ring to it!
