    <p>If you would like to have a session with me, please reach out to me via this website via this form. A standard
      way to operate now is to send me an email through the website and answer these few questions. You’re sending me an
      email because you’re curious if it’s a good fit and that we potentially Can work together and I can potentially
      help you move towards you want where you want to be. I will acknowledge you and if I think it’ll be a good fit and
      set up a first 20 minute zoom call for $20. This is more of a meet and greet And there’s a small payment so that I
      know you’re serious. It’s nonrefundable and I am seriously committed to this quick call.</p>
    <p>If this call is successful for you, for both of us. I will send a more in depth, questionnaire, or kind of intake
      sheet, and the next commitment is (3) 45 minutes sessions at least one week apart, but no more than two weeks apart
      and it’s a nonrefundable $60 per session. if there is continued success, the next commitment is another three
      sessions at $100 each. After that sessions can be completed at $150 per session as they are available on my
      calendar, or if desired they can be booked 4 at a time for $500 which is a savings of $100. All these is
      acceptable to reschedule at least a day in advance. No more than two times can there be a rescheduling in any
      three sessions to keep things peaceful. I don’t think things will get in the way that often if the universe wants
      us to connect</p>
    <p>
    If you would like to be in a group discussion environment please let me know.  I am very interested in groups of 3 to 6 people.  We can focus on topics, or it can be a group with a shared interest in growth.  Let me know if you “have your group”, or would like to join a male, female, or mixed gender group.  To enter or start a group we must first have a few individual sessions to help ensure a good fit.  The group is a minimum 6 month commitment every 2 weeks = 12 sessions.
